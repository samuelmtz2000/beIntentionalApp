# iOS Design Review Workflow (Xcode Simulator MCP)

Automated, evidence-based design reviews for native iOS apps using an Xcode Simulator MCP. Agents can boot simulators, install/launch apps, drive UI, inspect accessibility, and capture screenshots/recordings to produce rigorous, repeatable iOS design reviews aligned with Appleâ€™s HIG and WCAG AA.

## Concept

- Live device-first reviews using Xcode Simulator MCP
- Evidence capture via screenshots and recordings
- HIG- and WCAG-based evaluation with accessibility emphasis
- Optional Xcode Build MCP to produce artifacts (.app/.ipa)
