   - Daily statistics
   - Milestone celebrations
   - Backend synchronization

4. **Completion**
   - Health restoration to 1000
   - Return to active gameplay
   - Achievement system

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### iOS Components

- `GameStateManager`: Handles state transitions
- `MarathonRecoveryView`: UI for recovery tracking

### Backend Components
- Extended user model with game state and `runningChallengeTarget`
- New API endpoints for recovery tracking
- Progress synchronization
- Data validation

### HealthKit Integration
- Distance tracking (walking + running)
- Permission management
- Background updates
- Data aggregation

## 📊 Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus Area |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Week 1** | 5 days | Foundation & HealthKit Setup |
| **Week 2** | 5 days | Core Game State Management |
| **Week 3** | 5 days | Recovery System Implementation |
| **Week 4** | 5 days | Polish, Testing & Documentation |

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

1. **Health Depletion** → Game Over trigger
2. **Challenge Presentation** → Marathon recovery explanation
3. **HealthKit Authorization** → Request workout data access
4. **Progress Tracking** → Real-time distance updates
5. **Milestone Celebrations** → 25%, 50%, 75% achievements
6. **Completion** → Health restoration & return to game

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and approve technical specification
2. Set up development environment with HealthKit
3. Create feature branch: `feature/marathon-recovery`
4. Begin Week 1 implementation
